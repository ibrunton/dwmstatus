This is inspired by TrilbyWhite's dwmStatus program.  I modified it to suit my
needs.

If compiling for a laptop, use the `-DLAPTOP' flag in the Makefile in order to
enable battery monitoring.  If compiling on a desktop, or if you simply don't
want a battery monitor, comment out or remove that flag.

The program is dependent on stlarch's ohsnap.icons or terminusmod.icons font in
order to display correctly.

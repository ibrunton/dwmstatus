This is inspired by TrilbyWhite's dwmStatus program.  I modified it to suit my
needs.  There are two versions: one for a desktop, and one for a laptop.  The
difference is that laptop.c queries battery information and desktop.c doesn't.

The program is dependent on stlarch's ohsnap.icons or terminusmod.icons font in
order to display correctly.
